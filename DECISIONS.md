# BachelorPad+ Decision Log

This file is the human-readable decision register. Every row has a formal ADR
in `docs/decisions/` under the same number: `BP-ADR-0007` is `ADR-0007.md`.
Adding a decision means adding both.

## Decisions needed before the work they block

- **`.bpadx` envelope format** (phase 15). ADR-0011 says established KDF and
  AEAD implementations and no custom cryptography, which constrains this more
  than it looks: the choice of crate, envelope layout and versioning scheme
  should be agreed before code exists, not discovered during it.
- **What may leave the machine** (phase 8 layer three, phase 10). Generative
  providers and embeddings both imply sending document content somewhere.
  ADR-0006 keeps them optional; ADR-0011 governs what is permitted. Neither
  says which providers are acceptable.
- **Whether `bp-storage` may record extracted titles before phase 14 exists**
  (phase 9). ADR-0019 currently says no, and that is why the crate is built
  and unreachable. Everything phase 9 wants -- related notes, duplicate
  detection -- needs something recorded about each document, so this decision
  gates the phase rather than merely delaying it. Reversing it is allowed;
  doing so by accident is not.
- **specs.md section 22's warm-start target** (75 ms) is still unverified —
  the software renderer's time to first interaction cannot be measured, so
  half of ADR-0017's target has no number behind it.

## Open items

- **Time to first interaction is unmeasurable under the software renderer.**
  Slint exposes no rendering notifier there, so half of the ADR-0017 startup
  target has no measurement behind it. A hole, not a pass.
- **Scroll smoothness under CPU rasterisation is unmeasured**, and needs a
  capture rig. This is the standing revert condition on ADR-0017. The
  application's own typing-path latency *is* now measured and is not a
  problem: 376 µs p50 at 1 MB against a ~16 ms frame budget.
- **Comparative startup timing on Linux is unmeasured.** The shell builds and
  runs there, but WSLg's compositor makes timing unrepresentative. Needs a
  native Linux machine.
- ~~Keyboard shortcut delivery is unverified.~~ **Confirmed working**
  (2026-08-17, manual test). `KeyBinding` in a wrapping `FocusScope` matches
  during the capture phase, so the focused `TextInput` no longer swallows
  Ctrl+S.
- **Three things want security profiles, and the profiles now exist as a
  model.** The recovery journal writes unsaved text to disk in plaintext;
  clipboard history keeps copied secrets in memory; and `bp-storage` is
  built, tested and deliberately unwired, because the useful thing to record
  — a document's extracted title — is a summary of what the user wrote.
  ADR-0020 says what each profile permits over all three. **None of them
  reads it yet**, which is the next piece of work: the model makes the leaks
  describable, not fixed.

  Two of the four profiles require an encrypted recovery journal, which
  needs `bp-crypto` and does not exist until phase 15. ADR-0020 requires that
  to fail loudly — the journal is refused rather than silently written in
  clear — so those profiles are not fully honourable yet, deliberately and
  visibly.
- **The custom editor view has never been typed into.** Its rules are covered
  by 147 tests in `bp-editor`; the widget has been verified to exactly one
  standard, that it renders a frame with a real file open without panicking.
  Whether keys arrive, whether the caret lands under the pointer and which
  way the wheel scrolls are all open. `project/NEXT_SESSION.md` has the
  checklist.

  This used to carry "nothing depends on the answers yet". **That is no
  longer true.** Duplicate Line and Move Line Up/Down are enabled only under
  `--editor-view`, and Go to Line will be, so features now inherit whatever
  that caret does. The default is still `TextInput`, so nothing is *broken*
  by the answer being bad -- but a growing set of the product is unusable
  until somebody gives it.
- **A clipboard menu row can act on a different entry than the one it
  names.** Row ids are decoded against the clipboard history as it is at the
  moment of the click, not as it was when the menu was built, and a 1.2 s
  poll timer can add an entry in between. Predates the paste-transformation
  rows and applies equally to plain paste. Fixing it properly means freezing
  a snapshot of the history while a menu is open, which is a design question
  rather than a patch.
- **Most of the product has not been used.** 542 tests cover the pieces in
  isolation. One manual pass found two defects no test caught: a menu bar
  where twelve of fourteen menus swallowed clicks, and Save As defaulting to
  the process working directory, which wrote real documents into a git
  checkout. Integrated behaviour needs exercising, not more unit tests.
