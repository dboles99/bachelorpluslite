# BachelorPad+ Decision Log

This file is the human-readable decision register. Every row has a formal ADR
in `docs/decisions/` under the same number: `BP-ADR-0007` is `ADR-0007.md`.
Adding a decision means adding both.

## Open items

- **Time to first interaction is unmeasurable under the software renderer.**
  Slint exposes no rendering notifier there, so half of the ADR-0017 startup
  target has no measurement behind it. A hole, not a pass.
- **Scroll smoothness under CPU rasterisation is unmeasured**, and needs a
  capture rig. This is the standing revert condition on ADR-0017. The
  application's own typing-path latency *is* now measured and is not a
  problem: 376 µs p50 at 1 MB against a ~16 ms frame budget.
- **Comparative startup timing on Linux is unmeasured.** The shell builds and
  runs there, but WSLg's compositor makes timing unrepresentative. Needs a
  native Linux machine.
- ~~Keyboard shortcut delivery is unverified.~~ **Confirmed working**
  (2026-08-17, manual test). `KeyBinding` in a wrapping `FocusScope` matches
  during the capture phase, so the focused `TextInput` no longer swallows
  Ctrl+S.
